<h1> Purpose </h1>


<body> The purpose of this webpage is to create a website for Lab 7 of COMP 131. <br>
As this website, in its current form, will not serve any other purpose I have chosen to focus on sandwiches because <br>
it is the first image I had saved on my phone that I was comfortable sharing. <br>

<img src="Union_Sandwhich.jpg" alt="Sandwich" width="500" height="500" align="right">
